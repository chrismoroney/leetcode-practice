Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, with methods being called appropriately for each class.

What it is:
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface. 
The specific implementation is determined at runtime based on the actual object type. 
It means "many forms" - the same operation can behave differently depending on the object it's acting upon.

Why it's useful:
Flexibility: Allows writing code that can work with objects of multiple types.
Extensibility: New classes can be added to a system without changing existing code.
Simplified Code: Reduces conditional logic (fewer if/else statements checking object types).
Decoupling: Code depends on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
Modular Design: Promotes cleaner separation of concerns.
