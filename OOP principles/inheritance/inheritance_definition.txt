Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

What it is:
Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes, 
allowing a child class (subclass) to inherit attributes and behaviors from a parent class (superclass). 
The child class can then extend or override the inherited functionality.

Why it's useful:
Code Reusability: Eliminates the need to rewrite the same code in multiple classes. Common functionality can be defined once in a parent class.
Hierarchical Organization: Creates clear, logical relationships between classes, modeling real-world hierarchies.
Extensibility: Makes it easier to extend existing code without modifying it, following the open-closed principle.
Maintenance: Changes to the parent class automatically apply to all child classes (unless overridden).
